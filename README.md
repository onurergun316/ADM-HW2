### 8 Research Questions

      RQ 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis
      
      RQ 2 - Let's explore the dataset by finding simple insights into the reviews.
                  Plot the number of reviews for each application in descending order.
                  What applications have the best Weighted Vote Score?
                  Which applications have the most and the least recommendations?
                  How many of these applications were purchased, and how many were given for free?
                  

      RQ 3 - What is the most common time that authors review an application? For example, authors usually write a review at 17:44.
             Create a function that receives as a parameter a list of time intervals and returns the plot the number of reviews for each of the intervals.
             Use the function that you created in the previous literal to plot the number of reviews between the following time intervals:
               Initial time	Final time
                  06:00:00	10:59:59
                  11:00:00	13:59:59
                  14:00:00	16:59:59
                  17:00:00	19:59:59
                  20:00:00	23:59:59
                  00:00:00	02:59:59
                  03:00:00	05:59:59
            
      RQ 4 - As Steam is a worldwide platform, the reviews can be done in many languages. Let's extract some information about it.
                  - What are the top 3 languages used to review applications?
Create a function that receives as parameters both the name of a data set and a list of languages’ names and returns a data frame filtered only with the reviews written in the provided languages.
Use the function created in the previous literal to find what percentage of these reviews (associated with the top 3 languages) were voted as funny?
Use the function created in the literal “a” to find what percentage of these reviews (associated with the top 3 languages) were voted as helpful?
